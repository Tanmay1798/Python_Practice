# Interpreter vs Compiler

INTERPRETER
1) Translate program one statement at a time.
2) continues translating the program until the first error is met in which case it stops. Hence debugging is easy.
3) Programming language like Python , Ruby , etc. use Interpreter.

COMPILER
1) Scans the entire program and translate it as a whole into machine code.
2) It generate the error message only after scanning the whole program. Hence debugging is hard as compare to Interpreter.
3) Programming language like C , C++ , Java , etc. use Compiler
