# VARIABLE
Variables are names that can be assigned a value and then used to refer to that value throughout your code.
Rules:-
1) Variable names should start with letter (a-z).
2) A variable can start with "_"(underscore) also.
3) In variable we can't use special character.
4) We can use number but not at the beginning.
5) Keywords are not allowed as keyword.

# Interpreter vs Compiler
 
INTERPRETER
1) Translate program one statement at a time.
2) Continues translating the program until the first error is met in which case it stops. Hence debugging is easy.
3) Programming language like Python , Ruby , etc. use Interpreter.

COMPILER
1) Scans the entire program and translate it as a whole into machine code.
2) It generates the error message only after scanning the whole program. Hence, debugging is hard as compared to Interpreter.
3) Programming language like C , C++ , Java , etc. use Compiler.

# STATEMENT

Instructions that you write in your code and that a python interpreter can execute are called "Statement".
eg.   a = 10
      print(a)
      
      output = 10
in which a = 10 & print(a) both are statements.


# COMMENT

Instructions that you write in your code and that python interpreter ignores are called "Comment".
Denoted by 3 type
1) '#' Hash sign
2) ' ' ' --------------
    ----------- ' ' ' .
3) " " " --------------
    ----------- " " " .

# KEYWORD
Keywords are the reserved words in python. These reserved words cannot be used as function names , variable names , or any other identifiers.


eg:-
and | as | break| class | continue | def |del |elif | else | except | False | finally |for | from | global | if| import | in | is | lamba | None | nonlocal | not | or | pass | raise | return | True | try | while | with | yield


# INDENTATION
Indentation in Python refers to the (space and tab) that are used at the beginning of a statement or code we write.
1) Using indentation for a bunch of code is extremely elegant and contributes a lot to the clarity of any python program.
2) Our code starts looking well organized and more readable.

# DYNAMIC TYPING
In python, variables are reserved memory locations to store values. Python is a dynamically typed language in which it is not required to mention the type of a variable while declaring. It performs type checking at run time.

eg:- a = 10

# STATIC TYPING 
In statically typed programming languages, which is required to mention the type of variable while declaring. It performs type checking at compile time.

eg:- int a = 10
